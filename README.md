Hi there! I'm Telman 👋

I am a Software Engineer with a strong background in building robust applications using the .NET and Angular ecosystem. Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by exploring high-performance backend systems with Go and modern frontend patterns in React.

I'm also deeply curious about Artificial Intelligence and am busy experimenting with how to integrate AI capabilities into everyday developer workflows.

🚀 Currently focused on: Mastering Go and React to become a more versatile full-stack engineer.
🧪 Experimenting with: LLMs, prompt engineering, and AI-driven automation.
👯 Looking to collaborate on: Open-source projects involving .NET Core, Angular, or anything involving the Go/React stack.
💬 Ask me about: C#, TypeScript, RxJS, or why I'm excited about the Go runtime.
